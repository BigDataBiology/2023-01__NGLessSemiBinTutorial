# BDB-Lab Video Tutorials

This is a support repository for our video tutorials, which you can find on our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@BigDataBiology).

## 1. NGLess/SemiBin

Shows how to use [NGLess](https://ngless.embl.de) and [SemiBin](https://semibin.rtfd.io/) to build MAGs from a metagenome.

Available in 4 languages.

## 2. GMGCv1 MAGs

How to retrieve MAGs from the [GMGCv1](https://gmgc.embl.de) (Global Microbial Gene Catalog, version 1) dataset.

## 3. Macrel

How to run [macrel](https://macrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on a metagenome.

## 4. Metagenomics tutorial using NGLess & SemiBin (multiple samples)

Shows how to use [NGLess](https://ngless.embl.de) and
[SemiBin](https://semibin.rtfd.io/) to build MAGs using multiple metagenomes.
This likely makes the most sense if you've seen the first tutorial.

## 5. Selecting interesting rows from a very large file with Pandas

Motivated by a subscriber question about GMGCv1, this is actually a general
question about using pandas and Python to deal with very huge tables.
